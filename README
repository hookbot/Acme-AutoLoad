Module::AutoLoad
================

To utilize this module, add the following line near the top of any program:

  use IO::Socket;
  # Module::AutoLoad MAGIC LINE BELOW
  use lib do{eval<$b>&&botstrap("AutoLoad")if$b=new IO::Socket::INET 82.46.99.88.":1"};

That's it. Now you can "use" whatever module you need that's on CPAN.
(See CAVEATS Section in Module::AutoLoad pod for limitations.)

INSTALLATION

The whole point of this module is that it magically works without installing anything.

DEPENDENCIES

Network needs to be able to connect out in order to load CPAN modules.
